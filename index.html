        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Smart Car Parking System using IOT (Oct 2022) </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and implemented an automatic car parking system
                project using Arduino UNO. IR sensors are used for detecting
                the movement of vehicles and LCD are used to display the
                parking status.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Motion Sensing Alarm using IR sensor  (Aug 2023)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed an Motion sensing alarm. The PIR sensor detects the
                motion of an intruder whenever an motion is within its range. As
                it detects the infrared rays emitted by a body then it sends the
                signal to arduino uno and led glows with triggering buzzer.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Automatic Gatekeeper using PIR sensor with Arduino Tinkercad (Sep 2023)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The PIR sensor interfaced with Arduino is constructed in online
                Tinkercad simulation. How to make a prototype of a smart or
                automatic door using Arduino UNO,PIR motion sensor and
                Servo motor.</li>
